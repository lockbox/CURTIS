# CURTIS

This is named after curtis from [The Santa Clause (1994)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111070/) but has literally
nothing to do with the movie. Bernard and Curtis are buddy-buddy elves that run the north pole.

Bernard is the boss boss, and curtis operates accordingly.

IYKYK.

`CURTIS` is a runtime for the [Playdate](https://play.date/) I use for research.
